Our club is a place where reality meets the zenith of imagination. Just take up your camera and you will see that your angle of viewing the world changes everytime you click . And nothing will be more fun than being a part of this  club.</blockquote>

<h2 style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#006; text-align:center; background-color:#F30;">ARTURO : IIT ROPAR PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; color:#333;">Arturo is the photography club of Indian Institiute of Technology , Ropar . It has been the first most successful photography club of the institute , the result of the consistent efforts of the core members . Overwhelming response from the junta has been a major factor behind the formation and the successful continuation of the club. It is a club where we have regular activities  , contestes , lots of excitig prizes to be won and most importantly fun with photo-learning.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#006; text-align:center; background-color:#F30; text-transform:capitalize;">FOUNDATION</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; color:#333;">
There were continuous efforts for starting photography club since the institute came into being and a photography club took birth also but it faced many difficulties being the club of a newly formed institute. With the time , it eventually got buried up . As we all know that photography club resides at the heart of any institute . Any event held is recognised only by its pics and videos. So with the dire need of starting a photography club and  the  consistent efforts of core members  , finally ARTURO Photography club was founded on 11th Feb 2013 . 
Since then  , the club has not looked back and is growing every moment . Many events have been covered under the club and competitions are held. Moreover , the inundated response of the junta has added to the steps toward the success of the club.
